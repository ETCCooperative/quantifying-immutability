# Quantifying Immutability

This repository accompanies the Medium post Quantifying Immutability.

In this repo, you can find the D3.js code for immutability maps.
To run it, just go to that directory and run:
```sh
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Go to "0.0.0.0:8000" on your browser to view the immutability map. You can modify the files in the JSON.


In `formulas` you can find original LaTeX code for generating the scientific notation of the formulas proposed.

In the bitcoin directories, you can find both pre-release and first-version of Bitcoin code as found on this link:
